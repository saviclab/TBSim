## Welcome to TBsim

Welcome to the UCSF TBsim tool developed by Savic Labs in support of the CPTR program funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This tool allows simulations of the timecourse of drug concentrations, drug actions, bacterial dynamics, and host response during drug treatment of TB. All simulations are based on a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model based on data from non-clinical and clinical trials and literature.

You can visit the shiny app here: http://www.saviclab.org/systems-tb/

Some notes on use of this app:
1. Interfaces for either basic or advanced usage are provided, which can be switched at any time from the selector in the top-right corner. The 'Advanced' mode allows any setting to be altered, e.g. any of the QSP model parameters and all drug sensitivity and pharacokinetic parameters. The 'Basic' interface allows for more simple investigations, with standard drug regimens.
2. Various existing standard-of-care drug regimens are included, while the user can also create custom regimens to evaluate their predicted outcome.
3. The dashboard for population simulations allows simulations for multiple patients and to calculate expected outcome. Since population simulations are computationally intensive, these analyses are submitted to a job queue. We kindly request you to login via Google to use this functionality.


*Please note that this tool is a research tool for TB experts. Do not use this tool to inform individual treatment decisions.*
